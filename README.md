# Mercari Price Suggestion

## Overview
Welcome to my project on the Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge! This project showcases my exploration of data and application of machine learning techniques to solve the pricing prediction problem. 

### Description
In this project, I tackled the challenge of predicting product prices for Mercari, Japanâ€™s leading community-powered shopping app. With the vast array of products listed on Mercari's marketplace, accurately determining prices is essential. Leveraging exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning (ML), I aimed to develop an algorithm that suggests appropriate prices based on user-provided text descriptions, including details like product category name, brand name, and item condition.

### Objective
My objective was to delve into the dataset, uncover insights through EDA, and build predictive models using ML techniques. By understanding the relationships between features and prices, I aimed to create a robust pricing prediction system.

### Problem Statement
Given user-provided text descriptions of products, including details like category name, brand name, and item condition, predict the sale price of the listing.

### Dataset Description
This competition involves predicting the sale price of listings based on user-provided information. The dataset includes train.tsv and test.tsv files, which consist of a list of product listings in tab-delimited format. The data fields include:

- `train_id` or `test_id`: the ID of the listing
- `name`: the title of the listing
- `item_condition_id`: the condition of the items provided by the seller
- `category_name`: category of the listing
- `brand_name`
- `price`: the price that the item was sold for (target variable)
- `shipping`: 1 if shipping fee is paid by the seller and 0 by the buyer
- `item_description`: the full description of the item

Note: The data has been preprocessed to remove text resembling prices to avoid leakage.

## Data Fields
- `train_id` or `test_id`: ID of the listing
- `name`: Title of the listing
- `item_condition_id`: Condition of the items provided by the seller
- `category_name`: Category of the listing
- `brand_name`
- `price`: Price that the item was sold for (target variable)
- `shipping`: 1 if shipping fee is paid by the seller and 0 by the buyer
- `item_description`: Full description of the item

### Data Exploration
I conducted extensive EDA to explore the dataset, visualize distributions, analyze correlations, and identify factors influencing product prices. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, I gained valuable insights into the dataset's characteristics.

### Machine Learning
```Pending Task```
Using ML algorithms, I trained predictive models to estimate product prices based on the provided dataset. I experimented with various models, performed feature engineering, and optimized model performance to achieve accurate pricing predictions.

## Showcase of Work
This README serves as a showcase of my work on the Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge. It highlights my expertise in EDA and ML, showcasing the methodologies employed, insights gained, and the predictive models developed.

### Next Steps
I will continue to refine my models, explore advanced ML techniques, and enhance the accuracy of pricing predictions. Additionally, I am open to feedback and collaboration opportunities to further improve my work.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my project on the Mercari Price Suggestion Challenge!
